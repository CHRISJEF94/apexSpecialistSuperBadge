Repository that contains code related to the Apex Specialist quest

Hey! Thanks for visit this repository, it contains the whole code that I used to pass 
the Apex Specialist quest. I hope that It will help you!

Take in care the next points : 

- When you are creating the code to automate Maintenance Request you have to map
  most of the fields related to Maintenance Request, even the fields that doesn't 
  shown in the page layouts.
  
- When you validate some steps a Maintenance Request without related Work Parts is
  created, this causes problems sometimes.
